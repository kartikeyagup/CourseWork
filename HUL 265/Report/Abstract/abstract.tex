The goal is to do a systematic analysis of the work performed by a NGO of our choice. We have to analyze the work it does, the change it is bringing about by talking to the people associated with the NGO directly and indirectly both.

The NGO I have chosen is Synergy Sansthan. I have chosen it because I had done an internship there in December. Through the internship, I was able to closely witness the actual working of the NGO and understand it better.
