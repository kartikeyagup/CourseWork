\section{About}
Entrepreneurship Development Program was started at Synergy Sansthan with the help of ``Pravah'', a NGO based in Delhi. As the name suggests, it is related to developing entrepreneurial skills in individuals. 

\subsection{Goals}
The goals of EDP are to equip small and medium scale entrepreneurs with the skills needed to make their business bloom. To help them in procuring loans from the bank rather than from money lenders who would extort them. To make them independent eventually by making their business profitable for them.

\section{Case Study}

\subsection{Rajiv Jat - Photocopy shop}
Rajiv Jat ran a small photocopy shop in Harda city. His daily business was of Rs. 150. He faced a lot of difficulty in supporting his family. Synergy Sansthan helped him out in setting his business properly. They got him a loan so that he could purchase 1 computer for his shop and get Internet access. This allowed him to have a small cyber-cafe. This enhanced his business considerably as the number of people having Internet access in Harda were very few.
